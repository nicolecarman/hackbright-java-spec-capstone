# PurrfectHealth
## Hackbright x Optum Java Specializations Final Capstone Project

This is my final capstone project for the Hackbright x Optum cohort. My full-stack web application, PurrfectHealth, is a management system for a veterinary clinic that specializes in feline health. It's a user-friendly system that helps the vet staff keep track of clients and their cats.

Please note: None of the screenshots included in this ReadMe are of actual size.

#### User Dashboard
- Upon successful login, the user is taken to a dashboard that displays a welcome message with their first name, several upcoming appointments, a sidebar with quick links to add a new appointment, client (pet owners), or cat, and an area in the sidebar where they can create, view all, and delete notes for themselves.

Note: The screenshot below does not show the entire page. The field to add a note is not shown.

#### View all appointments, clients, or cats
- Users can click on the Appointments, Clients, and Cats pages to view all existing data in the system. On each page, there is a button provided to staff should they need to add a new appointment, client, or cat. Users can delete an appointment, client, or cat from this page when needed.
